Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ryan.  This is my GitHub profile.  It's just about my only internet presence at this point, so I try to keep it nice and shiny âœ¨ You can find stuff I'm working on in the pinned section.  I mostly work in Kotlin, I'm partial to Rust, and I'm a bit of a web3 degen ðŸ¤“

I don't do front end often, but when I do, it is for my personal site https://unredundant.io
